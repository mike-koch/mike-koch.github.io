client: Mobile Route Advisor for ETS2

description: The "Mobile Route Advisor" for Euro Truck Simulator 2 ("ETS2") is a skin for the <a href="https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server" target="_blank">ETS2 Telemetry Web Server</a>.  For those who have never played ETS2 before, there is a HUD in the bottom-right (or bottom-left for some users) that displays your current location on a map (similar to a GPS), information about your current job (such as income, destination), as well as damage information (i.e. truck damage and trailer damage).  I created a skin, using the JSON returned from the Telemetry Web Server to mimic the Route Advisor on a mobile device, freeing up that portion of the screen.  It's a small project; however many people are enjoying the benefits it provides.
