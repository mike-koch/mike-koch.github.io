description: eg-music.com, powered by <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, PHP, and MySQL, is the official site for Essential Groove, a band from the Cleveland area.  The website hosts upcoming events via Facebook and other sources, as well as provide member biographies and online music streaming / downloading via mainstream music sources (such as iTunes, Google Play, and Spotify).  There is also a separate "members only" area that I created from scratch (using PHP and MySQL), allowing members to update their biographies, names, and photo to display on the website. Certain members also have the ability to create/edit/delete members, hide members on the about page, as well as re-ordering member's positions on the website.
