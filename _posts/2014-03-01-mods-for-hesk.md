description: Mods for HESK is a compilation of various modifications, as well as a fresh new user interface for the popular, free helpdesk software HESK.  I originally started this project to update the look and feel of HESK, as it used tables for layouts and was not reponsive in any way.  However, using <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, along with jQuery and other libraries, I created the new interface.  Upon receiving several comments and thank-you's from other users of HESK, I went ahead and created several new features that have improved upon HESK's original functionality (I'm sparing the list of features from this page as they are all available on Mods for HESK's <a href="http://mods-for-hesk.mkochcs.com" target="_blank">official website</a>.  This is currently the largest project I have worked on to date and, despite HESK not following any current coding standards*, am enjoying on working.<br><br>* Some of the code is disturbing to try and figure out, as one page contains database queries, business logic, and views all at once!
