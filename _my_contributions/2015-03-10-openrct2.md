description: OpenRCT2 is a game decompiled from RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 written in C.<br>Originally, RCT2 was written in assembly, one of the most difficult programming languages in existence. By decompiling and rewriting the game to C, a more modern language, it is easier for developers to extend the game and even kill bugs from the original game. Another game, Transport Tycoon Deluxe, was reformed into OpenTTD through a similar procedure. OpenTTD has now thousands of new features and OpenRCT2 will walk that path too eventually.<br><br>So far my contribution has been quite minimal, adding some language string for en-US.  Once I have some more experience in C, hopefully I can provide more helpful/useful contributions.
