description: The Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) Telemetry Server is a web server that takes information from the ETS2 Telemetry SDK, and then makes the data accessible using a REST API, along with an HTML client that updates automatically using WebSockets.  I helped provide support for American Truck Simulator (a second game by the creators of ETS2).
