                    <p>I'm Mike Koch, a software developer and IT Consultant from the Cleveland, Ohio area, and I'm currently working as a Web Developer, primarily in Java and C#.</p>
                    <p>Whenever I'm not busy with work, you can find me at the golf course enjoying a round of 9 (and sometimes 18) holes, biking in the metroparks, at an Indians game, or behind the monitor working on my next side project, which will eventually show up in my portfolio. I may also be enjoying a game, which you can find out which one I'm playing via my <a style="color: black" href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/mkoch227" target="_blank">Steam profile.</a></p>
